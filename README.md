Connect 4 is a classic two-player strategy game where the objective is to be the first to get four of your colored discs in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Many AI systems have been developed to play Connect 4 at a superhuman level.

The key aspects of a Connect 4 AI system are:
Minimax Algorithm: The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in adversarial games like Connect 4. It recursively evaluates moves by assuming the opponent will play to minimize the player's score, while the player will play to maximize their score.

Alpha-Beta Pruning: This optimization technique can be used in conjunction with Minimax to reduce the number of nodes that need to be evaluated in the game tree, making the search more efficient.
